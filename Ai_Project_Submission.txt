Implementation:

The game begin with two groups: pink and cyan. every group has 3 NPC (2 soldiers and 1 carrier).
Each soldier has ammo and hp (health point) in the beginning of game,
there is 2 stocks of ammo (brown points on map), and there is 2 stocks of hp (green points on map).
The movement inside the rooms in the map was by A* algorithm.

Each NPC (soldier,carrier) has actions that belongs to him.

Soldier Actions:
1. FindTargetPoint // Find the closer ammo or health point to soldier
2. SetSecurePoint // Find the secure point in the current room
3. Attack
	3.1 Shoot // Shoot Bullet
	3.2 ThrowGrenade // Throw Grenade
4. SearchForAmmo // Soldier searching for ammo
5. SearchForHealth // Soldier searching for health
6. SearchForCover //Soldier searching for secure place (behind wall)
7. MoveToRandomRoom //run away
8. SearchForEnemy //transform his action to attack opponet.

Carrier Actions:
1. Suply ammo to his teammate soldiers.
2. Suply health points to his teammate soldiers.
3. if he get injured, he also can take hp or ammo from the stocks all over the map.

In each of level in the game there is logs beside the game that tell's us what is going on with the team NPC's.
when all of the NPC's of the team is dead, the game is over.

(We didn't add the visibility map, because when the game start, we didn't want that the will be on the map
and the visibility map will cover on the NPC's.

Thank you!
